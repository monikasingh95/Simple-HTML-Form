<h3>Next Assignment: 12th February</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Move the logo inside the black bar in the top.</li>
    <li>For this you have to cut and paste the logo tag inside the div tag for menu.</li>
    <li>Then decrease the size of the logo so that it is inside the black menu bar.</li>
    <li>Similarly, move the School Name inside the black bar at the top. School Name must be in the center like now.</li>
    <li>Remove the address text from the title. Just keep the school name. We'll add address later somewhere else.</li>
    <li>Change school name color so that it looks good in the black bar. Also change the font (Using google fonts, because you have learnt how to use google fonts in freecodecamp)</li>
    <li>The logo must be at the extreme right, and the Menu items (About, Courses, etc.) must be moved to extreme left.</li>
    <li>You are allowed to use google and copy codes (that is part of learning). But whatever you copy, you must understand.</li>
